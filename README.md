##Project Introduction


Income inequality has been a growing concern, impacting various aspects of society. In this project, we aim to analyze and predict whether an individualâ€™s annual income exceeds $50,000 based on a range of attributes. Using data extracted from the Census Bureau database by Barry Becker and Ronny Kohavi, we will leverage machine learning algorithms to identify key factors influencing income levels, such as age, education, occupation, and capital gain or loss.

The goal of this project is to uncover patterns and insights that can inform decisions in areas like business development, real estate, financial services, tourism, and education. By understanding these factors, we hope to contribute to strategies aimed at mitigating income disparity and promoting economic well-being.
