# Prediction-of-Adult-Income

## Project Introduction

Low income has become a significant concern in recent years, leading to numerous socioeconomic challenges. This project aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis to identify the key factors influencing unequal income distribution and propose strategies for improvement. Our primary objective is to classify and predict whether an individualâ€™s annual income exceeds $50,000 or falls below this threshold, based on a variety of attributes and parameters.

### Problem Definition

The data for this project has been extracted from the Census Bureau database by Barry Becker and Ronny Kohavi (Data Mining and Visualization, Silicon Graphics). The goal is to predict whether an adult's income is greater than $50,000 or less than or equal to $50,000. Several factors influence this prediction, including age, education, occupation, and capital gain or loss. 

Understanding these factors is crucial for various applications such as:

- **Business Development**: Assessing the potential for profit-making businesses in a city based on the average income of its residents.
- **Real Estate**: Determining preferences and market demands for different types of properties.
- **Financial Services**: Evaluating the eligibility of individuals for bank loans.
- **Tourism**: Identifying the demographic that would likely visit tourist attractions.
- **Education**: Analyzing the likelihood of residents choosing private versus public colleges for their children.

By employing machine learning algorithms, we aim to extract valuable insights and patterns from the dataset, using association rules to enhance our understanding of income distribution dynamics. This will help in making informed decisions and recommendations to address income inequality effectively.
